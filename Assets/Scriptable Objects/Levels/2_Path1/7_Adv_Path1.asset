  TextToType: This inscription tells MCName that a golden flower will signal that
    they are nearing the end of the forest and that soon they will be able to see
    the citadel from afar. Not much time had passed since they left the inscripted
    wall but the golden flower was already in sight and soon enough they left the
    forest and the citadel could be spotted in the distance. When MCName got to the
    gates of the citadel, they realized they were closed, a guard pops her head over
    the wall and asks what business MCName has in that place. They showed her the
    orb and she quickly requested the password, which was the answer to the riddle.
