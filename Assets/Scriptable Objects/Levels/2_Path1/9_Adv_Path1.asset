  TextToType: After the guard gets the right answer, the gates open and MCName walks
    in. Inside the citadel, a hooded figure approaches them. It's the messenger who
    told them to bring the orb to the order, she calls out for the other members
    of the order. She tells MCName that the orb is a key to a realm where Lord Gillah's
    people had been banished. It was hidden from him to prevent the return of a race
    who lived only to torture others. But it was too late, Lord Gillah was already
    informed about the orb's whereabouts. He stormed inside and stared straight into
    MCName's eyes. "Hand over the orb!". MCName grinned and nodded in disagreement.
