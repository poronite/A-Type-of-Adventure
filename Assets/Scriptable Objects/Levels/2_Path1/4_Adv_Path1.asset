  TextToType: Upon defeating the slimes, MCName travels deeper into the forest in
    search of said citadel. Somehow, MCName gets lost inside the forest until two
    demi-human forest dwellers approach them. MCName gets scared at first but doesn't
    treat the two strange creatures as a threat. The two present themselves as Y
    and Z. Y & Z start explaining to MCName how dangerous the inhabitants of the
    forest are and how they should find the exit as fast as they can and get out.
    As MCName tells them about their journey, they soon understand how important
    it is for them to get to the citadel and help them get on the right track to
    get to the said destination.
